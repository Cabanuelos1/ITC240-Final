Final Project overview
	
	My final project was about a fitness website I was making for a personal trainer friend. It has a basic list of Meals and workouts pulled from a database. I used dynamic navigation so if I needed to add some tabs to the nav bar, I could do it easily. I put a formhandler page to contact me by email when someone wants to submit an inquiry about nutrition plan or workout plan.
